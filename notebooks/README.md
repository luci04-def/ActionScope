# ActionScope

## Overview
ActionScope is a video action recognition project that uses a pretrained 3D CNN
to identify human actions from short video clips.

## Objective
- Load and process videos
- Extract frames
- Perform action recognition using a pretrained model

## Dataset
- UCF101 (testing)
- HMDB51 (optional)

## Project Structure
