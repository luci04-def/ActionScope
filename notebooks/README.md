# ActionScope

## Overview
ActionScope is a video action recognition project that uses a pretrained 3D CNN
to identify human actions from short video clips.

## Objective
- Load and process videos
- Extract frames
- Perform action recognition using a pretrained model

## Dataset
- UCF101 (testing)
- HMDB51 (optional)

## Project Structure
notebooks/
- frame_extraction.ipynb
- action_inference.ipynb
- action_label_mapping.ipynb

## Progress

- Day 1: Problem understanding and dataset selection
- Day 2: GitHub repository setup and structure
- Day 3: Video loading and frame extraction
- Day 4: Pretrained model integration and inference setup
