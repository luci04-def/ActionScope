Day 3 – Frame Extraction and Temporal Sampling

Objective:
- Load video files using OpenCV
- Extract frames from input videos
- Perform temporal sampling to select a fixed number of frames (16)
- Resize frames to a uniform resolution (112 × 112)

Details:
- Videos have variable lengths
- Evenly spaced frame indices are used for sampling
- This ensures consistent input size for the action recognition model

Status:
Frame extraction and sampling pipeline implemented and tested using UCF101 videos in Google Colab.
